HD 95086 b is an exoplanet of 4-5 Jupiter masses discovered with the instrument NaCo at the Very Large Telescope in Chile (Rameau et al., 2013a).

This exoplanet is located at a distance of about 50 to 70 au, which is between the two belts of debris of the system.

Its young exolanet is particularly red which might be caused by the presence of clouds in its atmosphere or a putative debris circumplanetary disk surrounding the planet (Desgrange et al., 2022).

I started to work on this project in Chile in 2019 under the supervision of GaÃ«l Chauvin and Patricio Rojo.
