The AU Mic system is young and has a nearby M-dwarf star harbouring a circumstellar debris disc. It has two discovered planets, AU Mic b and c on orbital periods of 8.5 days and 18.9 days (semi-major axes of 0.07 au and 0.11), respectively. In addition, large-scale structures within the disc were discovered and are moving outwards at high velocity.

We aim to study this system with the highest spatial resolution in order to probe the innermost regions and to search for additional low-mass companions or set detection limits. The star was observed with two different high-angular resolution techniques probing complementary spatial scales. We obtained new Ks-band sparse aperture masking (SAM) observations with VLT/SPHERE-SAM, which we combined with interferometric data from VLT/NaCo-SAM, VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY, and direct-imaging observation from VLT/SPHERE, see Figures below.

Adding the radial-velocity (RV) measurements enable us to even better constrain the presence of giant companions below 1 au. For instance, a companion of 3  Jupiter-mass at a semi-major axis of 0.1 au is ruled out by RV data.

My work was in this project was to compute the detection limits on the AU Mic system from the interferometric observations VLT/SPHERE-SAM, VLT/NaCo-SAM, VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY, direct-imaging observation VLT/SPHERE, and radial-velocity data. I used the tool pyMESS2 (pythonized version of MESS2, see Lannier et al. 2017)
