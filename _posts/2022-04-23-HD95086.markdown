HD 95086 b is an exoplanet of 4-5 Jupiter masses discovered with the instrument NaCo at the Very Large Telescope in Chile (Rameau+2013a).

This exoplanet is located at a distance of about 50 to 70 au, which is between the two belts of debris of the system.

Its young exolanet is particularly red which might be caused by the presence of clouds in its atmosphere or a putative debris circumplanetary disk surrounding the planet (Desgrange+2022, submitted).
