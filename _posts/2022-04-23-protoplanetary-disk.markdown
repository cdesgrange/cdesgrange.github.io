A large variety of protoplanetary disks have been detected with the instrument VLT/SPHERE, and many of them contain substructures such as cavities, rings or spirals. The origin of these substructures is still unknown. Are they caused by planets, but which are yet unseen? or by some other physical processes? To date, only the protoplanetary disk PDS 70 has two confirmed giant proto-planets. In this research project, I investigated a sample of fifteen young disks with the primary goal to discover exoplanets which some are supposed to be detectable or close to be. I applied the latest cutting-edge image post-processing in order to unveil them. Unfortunately, no highly robust candidates appear. 

In addition, I also looked into the morphology of the disks in near infrared through  Angular Differential Imaging, a yet unusual technique to post-process directly-imaged disks. Last, the application of six post-processing algorithms on a diverse sample of disks which have been imaged with various observational conditions enables me to compare their performance and robustness. The latest and more breakthrough post-processing MAYONNAISE confirms its state-of-the-art results to provide detailed disks images without distortion under good observational conditions.
