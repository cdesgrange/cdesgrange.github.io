My name is CÃ©lia, I am a French girl of 24 years old.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and more precisely in observations and instrumentation for exoplanet and disk imaging.

I am as well a traveler, a lover of great outdoors and landscape photographer.

One part of me loves do social activities as for instance bouldering, playing ultimate-frisbee or hanging out. The other part likes to be on its own, swimming, walking or reading. I am keen to read, whatever the kind of books: fantasy, science-fiction, fiction, biography, scientific or literature. One of my favorite books is la Horde du Contrevent from Alain Damasio.

I like cooking, even if clearly not always a success. I enjoy learning languages. Last September, I have started to learn Italian, as well, Italy is quite close from Grenoble where I currently live.

I am keen to experience new stuffs, as soon paragliding!

All in all, I am someone very lucky: I am well surrounded, with great friends and family, I have time for myself, and my job is my passion. I would not change my life for another one. I hope to pursue my journey in research for as long as possible.
