My name is CÃ©lia, I am a French girl of 27 years old.

I am an astrophysicist. By using observations from large telescopes on the ground or in space, my research focuses on how look like planetary systems, how planets form and evolve.

Since November 2024, I have been carrying out my first postdoc at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile as a ESO Fellow. This job allows me to work on my research on exoplanets and circumstellar disks, and observing at the emblematic Very Large Telescope 80 nights/year, as part of my observational duties (on UT3).

Besides work, I am a traveler, a lover of great outdoors and landscape photographer.

One part of me loves do social activities as for instance playing ultimate-frisbee, bouldering, or hanging out. The other part likes to be on its own, swimming, hiking or reading. I am keen to read, whatever the kind of books: fantasy, science-fiction, fiction, biography, scientific or literature. One of my favorite books is la Horde du Contrevent from Alain Damasio. 

I like cooking, even if it is clearly not always a success. I enjoy learning languages. 

I am well surrounded, with great friends and family.

I am very grateful for the life I have the chance to live, I would definitely not change it for another one. 
I hope to pursue my journey in research for as long as possible. 

Keep smiling!
