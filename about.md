My name is CÃ©lia, I am a French girl of 24 years old.

One part of me loves do social activities as for instance bouldering, playing ultimate-frisbee or hanging out. The other part likes to be on its own, swimming, walking or reading. I am keen to read, whatever the kind of books: fantasy, science-fiction, fiction, biography, scientific or literature. One of my favorite books is la Horde du Contrevent from Alain Damasio.

I am someone very lucky: I am well surrounded, with great friends and family, and my job is my passion. I would not change my life for another one. I hope to pursue my journey in research for as long as possible.
