My name is CÃ©lia, I am a French girl of 25 years old.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and more precisely in observations and instrumentation for exoplanet and disk imaging.

I am as well a traveler, a lover of great outdoors and landscape photographer.

One part of me loves do social activities as for instance playing ultimate-frisbee, bouldering, or hanging out. The other part likes to be on its own, swimming, hiking or reading. I am keen to read, whatever the kind of books: fantasy, science-fiction, fiction, biography, scientific or literature. One of my favorite books is la Horde du Contrevent from Alain Damasio.

I like cooking, even if it is clearly not always a success. I enjoy learning languages. I speak better Spanish than German even though I learnt German for ten years at school while Spanish I had to learn on the job in Chile during my five months there for a Master research project. Afterwards, I wanted to start learn Italian, as I was living in Grenoble so close to Italy, but well, hard to not mix Spanish and Italian... :)

I am keen to experience new stuffs, as paragliding!

I am well surrounded, with great friends and family.

I would not change my life for another one. I hope to pursue my journey in research for as long as possible. 

Keep smiling!
