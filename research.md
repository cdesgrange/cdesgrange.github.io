My research focus on Exoplanets and Disks imaging with the instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. My Ph.D. deals with pushing the limits of SPHERE in its current design and with the SPHERE+ upgrade towards a better understanding of the architecture of planetary systems, and planetary formation.

After 6 years of operations, SPHERE is one of the most prolific and efficient exoplanet imagers worldwide given its community and high scientific productivity. The synergy between instrumental studies and astrophysical interpretation is highly valuable as the signal extraction and data processing of faint exoplanets or disks from measurements requires a deep understanding of the instrument.
