My research focus on Exoplanets and Disks imaging with the instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. My Ph.D. deals with pushing the limits of SPHERE in its current design and with the SPHERE+ upgrade towards a better understanding of the architecture of planetary systems, and planetary formation.

After seven years of operations, SPHERE is one of the most prolific and efficient exoplanet and disks imagers worldwide. The synergy between instrumental studies and astrophysical interpretation is highly valuable as the signal extraction and data processing of faint exoplanets or disks from measurements requires a deep understanding of the instrument. 

In observations, my object of interests are in particular young and nearby systems. From a few millions years old as the protoplanetary disks which are the birth places where exoplanets form, to about twenty million year old when the gas in the system has vanished but the putative exoplanets or debris disks emit still enough light in the near infrared to be observed. At a few giga year old, direct-imaging observations have poor sensitivity and can detect only companions close to the regime of brown dwarves to date. Yet, observing old systems can be mandatory if one wants to combine direct-imaging observations with radial velocity measurements sensitive to small planets, as super-Earths. Old stars are more stable, increasing a lot the sensitivity of radial velocity measurements.



I have started to work in this field of direct imaging and in particular with the instrument SPHERE during my master research internships, back to 2019. 

Now, I think I have experienced the main steps of work in observation: from writing the proposal, making the observation blocks, to the data acquisition, processing and analysis. 

In particular,  

- I investigated baseline to cutting-edge image procressing technique to retrieve directly-imaged protoplanetary disks in near infrared during a master internship at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. I look for proto-exoplanets creating the observed substructures inside the disks from Assenssio-Torres et al. 2021.

- I led an in-depth direct-imaging and spectroscopic characterization on the young exoplanetary system HD 95086, recently published (Desgrange et al. 2022). This project started when I was in Chile, in 2019.

- I had the chance to go at Paranal to observe with SPHERE in 2019.


After acquiring, processing and analyzing observation, I chose to experience the other side of the mirror: instrumentation. During my master's thesis, I looked into instrumental limitations from polarization effects known as the Goos-HÃ¤nchen and Imbert-Federov effects. I compared theoretical predictions to experiments on the optical high-contrast imaging testbed at the Observatoire de Paris.


During my Ph.D. I keep developing expertise both in high-contrast imaging observations and instrumentation. In observations, my two main projects currently are first a survey coupling different detection methods, and second the characterization of a specific debris disk. In instrumentation, I am doing molecular mapping simulations to test different designs to upgrade potentially the low resolution integral field spectrograph (IFS) of SPHERE into a medium resolution IFS.
