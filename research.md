My research focuses on Exoplanets and Disks imaging mainly with the instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. <b>My Ph.D. aims to push the limits of SPHERE in its current design and with the SPHERE+ upgrade towards a better understanding of the architecture of planetary systems, and planetary formation.</b>

After seven years of operations, SPHERE is one of the most efficient disks and exoplanet imagers worldwide. As the signal extraction and data processing of faint exoplanets or disks from observations requires a deep understanding of the instrument, it is highly valuable to combine instrumental studies and astrophysical interpretation. 

From an <b>observation</b> perspective, <b>my main object of interest are young and nearby systems</b>. From a few millions years old as the protoplanetary disks which are the birth places where exoplanets form, to about twenty million year old when the gas in the system has vanished but the putative exoplanets or debris disks emit still enough light in the near infrared to be observed. At a few giga year old, direct-imaging observations have poor sensitivity and can detect only companions close to the regime of brown dwarves to date. Yet, observing old systems can be mandatory if one wants to combine direct-imaging observations with radial velocity measurements sensitive to small planets, as super-Earths. Old stars are more stable, increasing a lot the sensitivity of radial velocity measurements.

I have started to work in this field of direct imaging and in particular with the instrument SPHERE during my research internships in master, the first one dating back to 2019. 

<b> An observer in astrophysics wears several hats: from writing the proposal and making the observation blocks, to the data acquisition, processing and analysis. I enjoy experiencing these different jobs.</b> In particular,  

- In 2019, I had the chance to go at Paranal to observe with SPHERE in visitor mode. Now, this spring/summer 2022 I am patiently waiting for my observations to be executed in service mode, still with SPHERE. Exciting results to come?


  
  - During a master internship at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, I investigated baseline to cutting-edge image processing techniques. The goal was to <b>retrieve directly-imaged protoplanetary disks in near infrared to look for proto-exoplanets creating the observed substructures inside the disks</b>. This project was carried out in the context of the paper from Assenssio-Torres et al. 2021.

  - I led an <b>in-depth direct-imaging and spectroscopic characterization on the young exoplanetary system HD 95086</b>, recently published (Desgrange et al. 2022).

After acquiring, processing and analyzing observation, I chose to experience the other side of the mirror: <b>instrumentation</b>. During my master's thesis, I looked into <b>instrumental limitations from polarization effects</b> known as the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects. I compared theoretical predictions to experiments on the optical high-contrast imaging testbed Très Haute Dynamique 2 (THD 2) bench at the Observatoire de Paris.

During my Ph.D., I keep developing expertise both in high-contrast imaging observations and instrumentation. 
  
In observations, my two main projects currently are 
  
  - first a survey coupling different detection methods to have the more complete view of the exoplanetary systems investigated, and 
  
  - second the characterization of a specific debris disk. 
  
In instrumentation, I am doing molecular mapping simulations to test different designs to upgrade potentially the low resolution integral field spectrograph (IFS) of SPHERE into a medium resolution IFS.
