    <p>test</p>

<p>My research focuses on better understanding planetary system architectures, using an observational perspective.</p>

<p>My <b>main questions of interests</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the diversity of planetary system architectures? What does it tell us about planet formation and evolution? How can we relate it to the origin of our Solar System?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do the morphologies of debris disks constrain the underlying planet population?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we alone in the Universe?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From an <b>observational</b> perspective, <b>my main objects of interest are young and nearby (&lt;150 pc) systems</b>. From a few millions years old as the protoplanetary disks which are the birth places where exoplanets form, to about twenty million year old when the gas in the system has vanished but the putative exoplanets or debris disks emit still enough light in the near infrared to be observed. At a few giga year old, direct-imaging observations have poor sensitivity because current facilities are mainly sensitive to thermal emission of exoplanets. Thus, around old stars, direct imaging detect mainly companions close to the regime of brown dwarves to date. This is changing with the MIRI instrument on the JWST, by accessing the mid-infrared wavelengths coupled to the highest sensitivity of space telescopes, and in future with the high-contrast imagers to be installed on the ELT.
<br /></p>

<p>Since November 14, 2024, I have been a Fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. I have observational duties on the Unit Telescope 3 of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) located in the Atacama desert. In particular, I am the Fellow instrument scientist of the extreme adaptive optics instrument SPHERE. I am part of the SPHERE, SPHERE+ and SHARK-NIR consortia.</p>

<p>Previously, I carried out my Ph.D. at the University Grenoble Alpes in France, half-time at the Institut de Planétologie et d’Astrophysiques de Grenoble, and half-time at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. <b>My Ph.D. aimed to better understand planet formation by peering into the architecture of planetary systems</b>. In practice, I characterized known exoplanets (orbital motion, spectral emission) and dust belts (morphological parameters of the belt, dust properties), and looked for additional exoplanets. I mainly used the SPHERE instrument, coupled to other astronomical facilities (ESO 3.6/HARPS, HST/STIS, ALMA, Gaia, Hipparcos, SHARK-NIR, LMIRCam).</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><b> How did I start to work in the field of direct imaging of exoplanets? </b></p>

<p>I have started to work in this field, and in particular with the instrument SPHERE, thanks to my research internships in my Master studies, the first one dating back to 2019.</p>

<p><b> An observer in astrophysics wears several hats: from writing the proposa l and making the observation blocks, to the data acquisition, processing and analysis. I enjoy experiencing these different jobs.</b> In particular,</p>

<ul>
  <li> In 2019, I had the chance to go at Paranal to observe with VLT/SPHERE in visitor mode. Since 2020, I submitted proposals with various facities: ESO, LBT, JWST, HST, and got granted part of them (see my Resume).
  
  <li> During a master internship at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, I investigated baseline to cutting-edge image processing techniques. The goal was to <b>retrieve directly-imaged protoplanetary disks in near infrared to look for proto-exoplanets creating the observed substructures inside the disks</b>. This project was carried out in the context of the paper from Assenssio-Torres et al. 2021.</li>

  <li> I led an <b>in-depth direct-imaging and spectroscopic characterization on the young exoplanetary system HD 95086</b>, published (Desgrange et al. 2022). </li>

    
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <br />
  </p>


After acquiring, processing and analyzing observation, I chose to experience the other side of the mirror: <b>instrumentation</b>. During my master's thesis, I looked into <b>instrumental limitations from polarization effects</b> known as the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects. I compared theoretical predictions to experiments on the optical high-contrast imaging testbed Très Haute Dynamique 2 (THD 2) bench at the Observatoire de Paris.
