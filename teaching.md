Since 2017, I have taught in different contexts: <b> science courses for students </b> but as well <b>French as a foreign language for migrants </b>.

I gave math lectures and exercices correction to students in their first-year Bachelor of Biology (32 hours, in 2021, Grenoble Alpes University, France). I also taught Python to students in their third-year of Bachelor in Physics. More precisely, I was responsible of the lectures and hand-on sessions that I prepared on my own (16 hours, in 2022, Grenoble Alpes University, France).

Previously, I have been an Examiner in Mathematics and Physics to first and second-year students in Preparatory Class in Physics (40 hours, in 2019-2020, Buffon High-School in Paris, France). Preparatory Class correspond to intensive undergratudate courses which prepare to the exam of the French Grandes Ecoles.

My very first experience as a teacher was in the French organization Itin√©rENS in Lyon in 2017 and 2018 (40 hours, Lyon, France). I did my best to teach French to migrants coming all over the world, and with often a heterogeneous level but with the will to learn my native tongue.
